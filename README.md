# ImageMagick Parsing

This plugin replaces image parsing functionality built into NodeBB with ImageMagick, running on the host machine.

## Why replace?

NodeBB uses a js-only alternative, which may be slower, or less featureful. Additionally, animated gifs are supported with ImageMagick, while they are not supported in the bundled version.

## Requirements

* NodeBB v1.0.0 or a suitably recent version

## Setup

* None, just install and activate.
